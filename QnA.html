            <p class="font-italic">Q: how did you get into programming?</p>
            <p class="font-weight-light">A: There are tons of stories about how kids grow up programming, learning C++ before they even get to high school, but that is not my story. To be honest, the first time I had experience writing code was anything but an "Aha" moment for me. I was going through a coding bootcamp with Columbia SIAM, and I was the worst out of all of my friends. I just couldn't understand the relationship between the code and the machine. It took a couple years before I built up the courage to try again, and this time it was an independent study to build a "feature rich" website for my rock climbing team. After putting in the hours, figuring things out without any real guidance, I was hooked.</p>

            <p class="font-italic">Q: What are some non-technical skills that you have that help you in the technical field of computing?</p>
            <p class="font-weight-light">A: As an introverted person, I decided I would look to learning about psychology and social dynamics in hopes of preparing myself better for college and social life after college. I didn't realize it at the time, but  I was also learning how to lead groups, have productive disagreements, effective communication, and how to embrace the learning process, just to name a few things. In my opinion, these soft skills will be invaluable going forward in my career. I've heard my fair share of stories about development teams that do not act like teams, and in some cases enemies. Although, I've also heard many stories of development teams that are all truly going towards a common goal, and are able to act as such, and that is where I am shooting for.</p>

            <p class="font-italic">Q: If you were to relate the process of software development to any other process, what would it be?</p>
            <p class="font-weight-light">A: Rock climbing. At their peak, both could easily be described as a "Flow State Activity", and at their worst, they're enough to make you question not only your own capabilities, but also your own sanity. The difference is, someone pays you to go through the development process, but you pay a monthly membership to repeatedly feel defeated after that one move on the climb continues to stump you. The analogy isn't just skin deep though. Much like how an experienced rock climber has a love hate relationship with people telling him how to complete his problem climb, I feel much more satisfaction figuring out how to solve a code problem rather than just copying and pasting from Stack Overflow. One could even go very far with this analogy and say that being limited by strength but not technique when it comes to a climb could relate to how a person could know how to build an application but doesnâ€™t have the motivation "muscle" to actually go through with building it.</p>
