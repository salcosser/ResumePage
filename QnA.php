            <p class="font-italic question" >Q: How did you get into programming?</p>
            <p class=" answer">A: There are tons of stories about how kids grow up programming, learning C++ before they even get to high school, but that is not my story. To be honest, the first time I had experience writing code was anything but a lightbulb moment for me. I was going through a coding bootcamp with Columbia SIAM, and I was the the least competent out of all of my friends. I couldn't understand the relationship between the code and the machine. It took a two years before I built up the courage to try again, and this time it was an independent study to build a "feature rich" website for my rock climbing team. After putting in the hours, figuring out solutions to technical problems like connecting local database to a website with PHP without any real guidance, I was hooked.</p>

            <p class="font-italic question" >Q: What are some non-technical skills that you have that help you in the technical field of computing?</p>
            <p class=" answer">A: As an introverted person, I decided I would look to learning about psychology and social dynamics in hopes of preparing myself better for college and social life after college. I didn't realize it at the time, but  I was also learning how to lead groups, have productive disagreements, effective communication, and how to embrace the learning process, just to name a few things. In my opinion, these soft skills will be invaluable going forward in my career. I've heard my fair share of stories about development teams that do not act like teams, and in some cases enemies. Although, I've also heard many stories of development teams that are all truly going towards a common goal, and are able to act as such, and I strive to act as a team member of groups similar to those.</p>

            <p class="font-italic question">Q: If you were to relate the process of software development to any other process, what would it be?</p>
            <p class=" answer">A: Rock climbing. At their peaks, both could easily be described as a "Flow State Activity". At their worst, they're enough to make you question not only your own capabilities, but also your own sanity. The difference is someone pays you to go through the development process, but you pay a monthly membership to continually push yourself to your limits just for the enjoyment of the process of doing so. The analogy isn't just skin deep. Much like how an experienced rock climber has a love hate relationship with people telling them how to complete their problem climb, I feel much more satisfaction figuring out how to debug an issue rather than just copying and pasting from Stack Overflow. One could even go as far as to say that being limited by strength but not technique when it comes to a climb could relate to how a person could know how to build an application but doesnâ€™t have the motivation "muscle" to actually go through with building it.</p>

            <p class="font-italic question" >Q: What are you up to now?</p>
            <p class=" answer">A: Well, when I'm not at college, I'm home constantly looking 
for ways to better myself in this field. Whether that's little things like keeping up with 
latest trends in computing technology,  diving into a side project, or attempting to learn a 
new language, I'm always looking for ways to get better. At the very least, I try to keep my 
mind moving. During the school year, I am studing at Marist college and I am on track to graduate in the spring of 2022. I am pursuing a BS in Computer 
Science with a concentration in Software Development, with minors in IT and Cybersecurity.
I also have plans to pursue a MS in Software Development through a five year program at my 
school. Other than academics, I also work as a software developer with Marist's CCAC group's agile development team. This team is assigned regular semester long work contracts with an accounting company named Collective Strategies. The experience I'm gaining from working with this group goes far beyond what I get from just writing code for a class or a side project. With this job, I am getting experience talking to the client on a regular basis, implementing new features, meeting deadlines, and being there if anything goes awry. The main work that I have done for the project is helping to build out the Check Request Tool API and updating our API to be able to use segments, or specific parts of an accounting document.</p>

            <p class="font-italic question" >Q: What is the quote about at the beginning of the site?</p>
            <p class=" answer">A: Right when you arrive at this site, you are greeted with the quote "No problem can be solved from the same level of conciousness that created it.". The first time I read this quote, I saw how it applied to so many parts of my life, although for our purposes, the context of software development. In my opinion, this quote fits perfectly with the process of debugging code. If the developer has taken the time to make sure that the issue is not a syntax error, an issue with the scope of a function call, or something of that nature, it's best to step away and rethink the issue. If the problem could be solved by the same level of conciousness of the person who wrote the code, and assuming said developer did an adequate job then there wouldn't be the problem in the first place. This does omit the possibilty though that the person could not have the technical skill to build that component of the codebase, in which case it would be the fault of someone else. The root of what I am attempting to convey is that as long as the issue is not a lack of technical skill, it is probably best to take some time away from staring at the code and possibly rethink the process.</p>
