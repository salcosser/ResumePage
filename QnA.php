            <p class="font-italic question" >Q: How did you get into programming?</p>
            <p class=" answer">A: There are tons of stories about how kids grow up programming, learning C++ before they even get to high school, but that is not my story. To be honest, the first time I had experience writing code was anything but an "aha" moment for me. I was going through a coding bootcamp with Columbia SIAM, and I was the the least competent out of all of my friends. I just couldn't understand the relationship between the code and the machine. It took a couple years before I built up the courage to try again, and this time it was an independent study to build a "feature rich" website for my rock climbing team. After putting in the hours, figuring out things like how to link a local database to a website with PHP without any real guidance, I was hooked.</p>

            <p class="font-italic question" >Q: What are some non-technical skills that you have that help you in the technical field of computing?</p>
            <p class=" answer">A: As an introverted person, I decided I would look to learning about psychology and social dynamics in hopes of preparing myself better for college and social life after college. I didn't realize it at the time, but  I was also learning how to lead groups, have productive disagreements, effective communication, and how to embrace the learning process, just to name a few things. In my opinion, these soft skills will be invaluable going forward in my career. I've heard my fair share of stories about development teams that do not act like teams, and in some cases enemies. Although, I've also heard many stories of development teams that are all truly going towards a common goal, and are able to act as such, and that is where I am shooting for.</p>

            <p class="font-italic question">Q: If you were to relate the process of software development to any other process, what would it be?</p>
            <p class=" answer">A: Rock climbing. At their peak, both could easily be described as a "Flow State Activity", and at their worst, they're enough to make you question not only your own capabilities, but also your own sanity. The difference is, someone pays you to go through the development process, but you pay a monthly membership to repeatedly feel defeated after that one move on the climb continues to stump you. The analogy isn't just skin deep though. Much like how an experienced rock climber has a love hate relationship with people telling him how to complete his problem climb, I feel much more satisfaction figuring out how to solve a code problem rather than just copying and pasting from Stack Overflow. One could even go very far with this analogy and say that being limited by strength but not technique when it comes to a climb could relate to how a person could know how to build an application but doesn’t have the motivation "muscle" to actually go through with building it.</p>

            <p class="font-italic question" >Q: What are you up to now?</p>
            <p class=" answer">A: Well, when I'm not at college, I'm home constantly looking 
for ways to better myself in this field. Whether that's little things like keeping up with 
latest trends in computing technology,  diving into a side project, or attempting to learn a 
new language, I'm always looking for ways to get better. At the very least, I try to keep my 
mind moving. During the school year, I am studing at Marist college. I am pursuing a BS in Computer 
Science with a concentration in Software Development, with minors in IT and Cybersecurity.
I also have plans to pursue a MS in Software Development through a five year program at my 
school. Other than academics, I also work as a software developer with Marist's CCAC group's agile development team. This team Gets regular semester long work contracts with an accounting company named Collective Strategies. The experience I'm gaining from working with this group goes far beyond what I get from just writing code for a class or a side project. I'm also getting experience talking to the client on a regular basis, implementing new features, meeting deadlines, and being there if anything goes awry. The main work that I have done for the project is helping to build out the Check Request Tool API and updating our API to be able to use segments, or specific parts of an accounting document.</p>

            <p class="font-italic question" >Q: What is the quote about at the beginning of the site?</p>
            <p class=" answer">A: Right when you arrive at this site, you are greeted with the quote "No problem can be solved from the same level of conciousness that created it.". The first time I read this quote, I saw how it applied to so many parts of my life, although for our purposes, the context of software development. In my opinion, this quote fits perfectly with the process of debugging code. In order to be able to solve the problem at hand, as long as its not as simple as missing a semicolon, the developer needs to be able to change their frame of thinking. The reason being that clearly the way that the developer is thinking about the problem, or how to solve the problem, is not helpful to the process. Sometimes, this doesn’t mean racking one’s brain about how to have a paradigm shifting new mindset, but maybe just stepping away from the workplace or letting someone else take a look. This is extremely important in my opinion. So many of us in this field get into a mode of just constant work, or being in a “flow state”. The only problem is that this way of operating is not very conducive to openness to new ideas and ways of thinking.</p>
