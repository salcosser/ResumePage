        <div class="card-body">
            The task of this project was to use stacks and queues, which we wrote ourselves,
            to be able to test whether or not each item of a 666 line text document is a
            palindrome.

        <div class="card-body">
            This document describes four different methods for sorting items, and implementations of those methods, or algorithms, in C++. The four methods areknown as insertion sort, selection sort, merge sort, and quick sort. Merge sortand quick sort are more efficient as they implement recursion within their sorting processes.

        <div class="card-body">
            This document explains the implementations of linear search, binary search, and hash tables using C++. The organization of each section will generally follow the format of a brief explanation of the function, the code itself, and anexplanation of the code with references to line numbers.

        <div class="card-body">
            This document describes the implementations of Binary Search Trees and unweighted graphs, along with the methods associated with each. As seen inthe table of contents, this document will follow the high level structure of first defining each of the data structureâ€™s implementations in detail, followed by an asymptotic running time analysis of the searching algorithms within each of the data structures.

            This documentation describes the implementation of the Bellman Ford Single Source Shortest Path Algorithm to relax weighted graphs. Also, it includes an imperfect implementation of a greedy approach to the fractional knapsack problem.

        <div class="card-body">
            With current events in late 2020, we are currently past the point where a test forthe novel virus is hard to come by. Although despite this, there is something to be said for the efficiency of the tests. As described by my professor, during the time of WWII, there was a need for a more efficent way to test for infections. One idea was pooled testing. With this approach, instead of handing out individual tests, a set of people would all be swabbed or sampled, all of the samples would be compiled into one testable container, and the container would be tested as a whole. If the test comes back negative, everyone is assumed tobe clear, and if not, the sample set is split into two sub samples and repeat the process. After a certain point, the testing facility will decide to go to individual tests to ensure who is actually positve. With this approach, instead of using 1000 tests on 1000 people, the number of tests can sometimes be reduced down to under 250 for the same sample size.
