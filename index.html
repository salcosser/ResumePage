              I am a computer science student studying at Marist college. I first got in to programming
              in my senior year of high school where I decided to challenge myself to make a website from
              the ground up, with a fully functional forum, without having any prior knowledge of how to 
              write anything in a computer language. This taught me the basics of how to use
              frontend languages as well as getting introduced to SQL and PHP. From then on,
              I have continually challenged myself to new projects constantly, whether it be
              part of a school assignment or a side project. The source code for each project is hyperlinked
              through the title of the project.

                    The project featured here is my final project for my software development 1 class.
                    The goal was to make a workout tracker for myself that would let me keep track of
  the workouts that I do, as well as doing some minor metrics work. Because of the fact that there was 
  going to be a fair amount of data that I would want to store in a non-volitile way, I knew that I would
  have to use a database. As stated in my initial about me, I did have a little experience working with SQL
  from the website, but it was so long ago that I needed to re learn it. I also met with my professor for guidance, 
  as doing database work in Java was a whole new ball game for me. He instructed me to use Hibernate. This was a 
  software designed to make the connection between Java and SQL more fluid. Without it, one would have to use JDBC,
  an archaic method involving writing out every SQL command before sending it. That is not to say that Hibernate makes
  it easy, There is a lot to learn about setting up the classes so they can communicate the data accurately to the database,
  although Hibernate does make it a lot cleaner to work with once everything is set up. I ended up also using MySQL Workbench
  in order to keep track of the databases, which made it very simple. This project is still a work in progress, as I am planning to
  roll out an update that would let users calculate their max weight for each number of reps, from within the application.
  The main function is workout tracking by exercise with weight, reps, and sets. Other functionality includes injury tracking, and 
  the ability to look at basic metrics including your hardest you've hit each exercise, and seeing the maximum weight you have ever 
  used for each exercise. Some side functionality is the ability to have multiple users.

                        This project was really about pushing the limits of what one can do with pure Python, aside from the graphics package. 
In my opinion, python is meant to be implemented by larger systems or programs, and not to be used by itself. Although, When
used on its own, it is very efficient. This project, which was my final project for Intro to Programming, plays the card game
War against itself until one "player" either runs out of cards or they play 100 hands. At that point, the "player with the greatest
amount of cards wins. This limit was put on as during testing, there were some matches that would last over 2000 hands. The code itself
is quite simple, although I loved making it. This program was my first introduction into object oriented programming, and it shows in the 
code. I made my own classes for the decks of cards and for the games. It took me a while to figure out how to make a deck of cards out of 
two arrays, but my method of putting each card into a string and parsing it out afterwards proved useful. The algorithm for the game
was more complicated. In the end, it could easily be mapped out with a decision tree, but at the time I was just going off of what
I thought would work. I actually developed my own way of interpreting it. Also, as a side note, the game will only go into double war, after
that, the hand is split evenly and re-dealt, making sure to shuffle the stack prior to avoid an infinite loop. The only user input is 
how many times the deck is shuffled, as the computer plays against itself. The implementation of the graphics module was used to make a
 simple poker table, to simulate the play area.

                        To begin, I am aware that it would be a lot better to have a hyperlink to the page, although, it is no longer active. The reason being 
                        the fees to keep the site active was really starting to add up. Although, all of the sourcecode is on the GitHub link. This project 
                        was the hardest thing I have ever done at the time. I was just getting into my senior year of high school and I wanted to start programming.
                        The obvious place to start was a website. So, I decided to take it upon myself to make a website for my rock climbing team, hence the name
                        teamrcf. Through this projects I got my first experience of the problem solving I would have to do later on down the line as a programmer.
                        I taught myself HTML and CSS through books that I bought. I Then used online resources, mainly w3schools.com. This website helped me with all
                        that I would need to know to get started, even with CSS. I then obviously turned to stackoverflow for my JavaScript questions. I would search
                        for hours looking for solutions, and I felt so accomplished when I would succeed. Once the frontend was done, I wanted to tackle a bigger 
                        challenge. Making a custom built forum for the climbing team. Complete with different permission levels for team members, parents, and coaches.
                        This meant getting into the territory of backend development. Here I learned how to use PHP and SQL to keep up the backend of websites. It 
                        was a great experience, being able to be the graphic designer, the front end developer, and the backend developer. To be frank, looking back
                        through the code it is obvious that a lot of it is just thrown together from different websites, although this didn't matter much. All that
                        mattered was that I started at nothing, and ended with a working product.
