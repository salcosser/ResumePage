      <p>
        The project featured here is my final project for my software development 1 class. 
        The goal was to make a workout tracker for myself that would let me keep track of the workouts that I do,
         as well as doing some minor metrics work. Because of the fact that there was going to be a fair amount of data
          that I would want to store in a non-volitile way, I knew that I would have to use a database. As stated in my
           initial about me, I did have a little experience working with SQL from the website, but it was so long ago that
            I needed to re learn it. I also met with my professor for guidance, as doing database work in Java was a whole 
            new ball game for me. He instructed me to use Hibernate. This was a software designed to make the connection between
             Java and SQL more fluid. Without it, one would have to use JDBC, an archaic method involving writing out every SQL
              command before sending it. That is not to say that Hibernate makes it easy, There is a lot to learn about setting 
              up the classes so they can communicate the data accurately to the database, although Hibernate does make it a lot 
              cleaner to work with once everything is set up. I ended up also using MySQL Workbench in order to keep track of the databases, 
              which made it very simple. This project is still a work in progress, as I am planning to roll out an update that would let users
               calculate their max weight for each number of reps, from within the application. The main function is workout tracking by
                exercise with weight, reps, and sets. Other functionality includes injury tracking, and the ability to look at basic metrics
                 including your hardest you've hit each exercise, and seeing the maximum weight you have ever used for each exercise. 
                 Some side functionality is the ability to have multiple users.
